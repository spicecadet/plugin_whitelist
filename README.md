## Introduction
Plugin Whitelist is a Must Use plugin for WordPress that restricts plugins to ensure that only approved plugins can be activated by content creators in WordPress. The whitelist can be hosted in the cloud for a central source of truth that will apply the same list to many instances of WordPress. The plugin stores the whitelist in a transient which expires after 24 hours.
